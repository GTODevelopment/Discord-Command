# FREE SCRIPT, DISCORD COMMAND (IN-GAME)

Here we have a nice FiveM ready script that allows you to do /discord in game.  With that command when you do /discord it will make an invite in the chat box appear that way you may join that discord link you put in there.  This is a script that can be used on Standalone/ESX/Qb-Core/Q-Bus.  Hope you all enjoy! ðŸ™‚
